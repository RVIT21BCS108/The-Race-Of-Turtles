The Turtle Race Betting Game is a Python-based simulation where users can place bets on different colored turtles racing across the screen. The program utilizes Python's turtle module to create a graphical interface and simulate turtle movements. Users are prompted to choose a turtle color they think will win the race, and once they place their bet, the race begins.

Key Features:

1) User Interaction:Users are prompted to make their bet by selecting a color from a list of six available turtle colors.Input is taken using screen.textinput() to allow user interaction via a pop-up dialog box.

2) Turtle Setup:Six turtles of different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) are created using the Turtle class. Each turtle starts at a specific position on the left side of the screen (x=-230), aligned at different y positions to simulate a starting lineup.

3) Race Simulation:Once the user places a bet, the race begins (is_race_on = True). Turtles move forward by a random distance (0 to 10 pixels) in each iteration of the race loop. The race loop continues until one of the turtles reaches the right edge of the screen (xcor() > 230), indicating a winner.

4) Outcome Evaluation:When a turtle wins the race, the race loop ends (is_race_on = False). The winning turtle's color is determined (winning_color = turtle.pencolor()).If the winning turtle's color matches the user's bet, a message declares the user as the winner; otherwise, it declares them as losing the bet.

5) Graphical Interface:The race simulation runs within a graphical window (Screen() from turtle module).Users can click anywhere on the screen to close the application (screen.exitonclick()).
